# Research Repository

This repository contains a collection of Python and JavaScript codes that I've created for various purposes.

## Contents

### - Python Code:

- **Burger Menu** _(Burger Menu Component I wanted to use in the future)_
- **Button Colour** _(Simple Button Colour Switcher)_
- **Circle Game** _(A simple Python Game)_
- **Meal Generator** _(Random Meal Generator)_
- **Hello World** _(First Time Using Python)_

Some of these Python codes require tkinter for GUI functionality.
To install tkinter, run

```bash
pip install tk
```

### - JavaScript Code:

- **Grade Calculator** _(One of my first Full-Stack Projects)_
- **Chat-bot** _(My first Chatbot)_
- **ThemeToggler** _(To use this code, copy the `toggleTheme()` function and call it when you want to toggle the theme.)_

### How to Use

To use these codes, you can either copy them individually from this repository or clone the entire repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GeneGilSario/Research-Repository-WC.git
```
