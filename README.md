# Research Repository

This repository contains a collection of Python and JavaScript codes that I've created for various purposes.

## Contents

### - Python Code:

- Burger Menu (Burger Menu Component I wanted to use in the future)
- Button Colour (Simple Button Colour Switcher)
- Circle Game (A simple Python Game)
- Meal Generator (Random Meal Generator)
- Hello World (First Time Using Python)

Some of these Python codes require tkinter for GUI functionality.
To install tkinter, run

```bash
pip install tk
```

### - JavaScript Code:

- Grade Calculator (One of my first Full-Stack Projects)
- Chat-bot (My first Chatbot)
- ThemeToggler (To use this code, copy the `toggleTheme()` function and call it when you want to toggle the theme.)

### How to Use

To use these codes, you can either copy them individually from this repository or clone the entire repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GeneGilSario/Research-Repository-WC.git
```
